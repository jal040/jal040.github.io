              <div class="project-text">Sunday Night Dinner is a Hollywood-based craft services company owned and managed by James Lee, an ambitious and successful entrepreneur. Since the company has been around since 1997, James sought out to redesign the SND's website to emphasize his passion as well as his beautiful crafty tables and other offered services. I worked on a team of four to deliver mockups, prototypes, and a responsive functional website.
              <br>
              <br>
              Our client was interested in getting users to visit the newly redesigned website to get more information about the services provided and to directly call him for business deals. Since the old website was entirely outdated and only partly functional, the client welcomed the idea of a complete rebranding of the website using their logo as the basis.

            <div class="project-text">We conducted a series of 10 interviews to gain a better understanding of how the craft service hiring process happens. Our goal was to determine basic pain points when hiring a craft service company and what information is essential. We gathered some useful feedback about how production managers go about hiring a craft service company, what they look for, and what their expectations are. Some of the questions we asked were:
            <br><br>
              <ul>
                <li>What quality of a craft services company do you find most important?</li>
                <li>What specific services have you previously chosen to hire from a craft company before?</li>
                <li>How did you hear about certain craft companies?</li>
                <li>What is the process like to book their services?</li>
                <li>How often do you hire crafting services?</li>

              <br>
              <br>

This was important to establish in the beginning because clients may feel the need to add more features to stand out against competition. I brainstormed all the basic functionalities that Notely should have and then some more complex features. I prioritized the stories by which ones were absolutely needed for the MVP and which ones could come later. The user flows were a result of the top priority user stories: signing up for an account, creating a file, and sharing a file.</div>

                One of the key findings from the testing revealed that many users were confused by the concept of “Add Space”. I was trying to give users an easy way of categorizing their items by being able to create a “space” but it was essentially the same idea as folders. This was too repetitive and confusing so I decided to implement tags which gives users a simplier way to categorize their items.</div>

                <div class="project-text">The challenges I faced during the creation of Notely taught me the importance of researching and understanding user objectives. Instead of focusing on the current cloud storage applications that are out there, I needed to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Instead of asking how can I improve on the existing features, I needed to ask what about this product makes it user friendly.

                <div class="project-title">If I had more time...</div>
                <div class="project-text">I realized that my target audience was too general. Most people who have used the reputable cloud storage applications have not faced many issues with it so it was harder to find their pain points. Instead, I should have interviewed people who don’t use cloud storage apps to uncover why they don’t and what would change their minds. I would do more market and user research.
