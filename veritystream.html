            </div>

            <div class="text-container">

              <div class="project-text">VerityStream is a platform that aims to unite all the processes for healthcare organizations, including provider applications, verification, privileging, and much more. The platform offers a wide variety of solutions and I worked on all the major products, from updating archaic screens to designing completely new features.

              <div class="project-title">Be an advocate</div>
              Being the only designer at a company isn't easy. It didn't help my nerves that this was my first full time job as well. I had to constantly push for the importance of design and attempt to incorporate a design process, while feeling unsure about what I was doing. Thankfully, many others were open to trying new things and I was able to set up a process. I argued for user testing and started with internal employees. I emphasized the importance of including developers earlier into the design phase to hear their ideas. I questioned the requirements and how the new feature fits into the customer's needs. It wasn't perfect but we were all willing to improve.

              <div class="project-title">Fail fast</div>

              Most of us know this phrase, but it can be difficult to practice. When I first joined the company, everyone accepted my work without much pushback. This excited me at first because I felt I was producing good work; however, a few months in, a coworker came to me asking me about one of my earlier designs and I was surprised to see how terrible the ux was. The design was already released and resources had already been spent. I realized I needed to fail faster in order to try more and different solutions instead of charging ahead with the first idea.

              <div class="project-title">Effective Communication</div>
              Getting my point across doesn't come as naturally to me as it does to others. With a little imposter syndrome mixed in with shyness, my thoughts can sometimes get jumbled up when presenting my work. However, the leads and product managers I worked with were genuinely open-minded and were eager to hear what I had to say. They helped build my confidence and our discussions became more and more engaging. I also had to constantly get out of my comfort zone and reach out to different teams, such as sales or customer support, to gain insight into the user's journey and the problems the customers encountered.

              <div class="project-title">Moving Forward</div>
              I am extremely grateful for my time at VerityStream and the support I received. I was growing as a designer but in my mind, I felt my growth was too slow. I wanted to put myself in a tougher environment with other designers to get more critical feedback about my work. So after 2 years at VerityStream, I accepted the ux designer position at Whova, an events management software startup company. Moving on to the next chapter in my life! &#128516;
