          <div class="project-title">Problem</div>
          <div class="project-text">Today’s market for cloud storage applications is saturated with products more catered towards businesses than personal use. As people become more reliable on cloud storage to create and save content, it quickly becomes unorganized.</div>
          <div class="project-title">Solution</div>
          <div class="project-text">Notely is the simplified pocket-notebook for people to quickly jot down notes, collect their thoughts, and share their ideas. It is easily accessible and promotes organization by quick search results, folder structures, and the ability to tag content.</div>

          <div class="project-title">Getting to know the users</div>
          <div class="project-text">To understand the users and their needs better, I conducted a Google survey from different areas throughout California. I found that there are certain features that have equal importance, which are the abilities to create, store, and share content.Only half the participants use cloud storage for images, which was an area I could focus on.</div>

        <div class="text-container">
          <div class="project-text">What caught my attention was that 100% of the participants used cloud storage for personal use, even though most of these applications were geared towards businesses. 86% of the participants found tagging to be useful or possibly useful. This got me to start thinking about implementing tagging into the product. Lastly, everyone thought it was important to be able to access their files on their phones.</div>

          <div class="project-text">These results proved the need to have an easily accessible space for personal use, a tagging feature for organization, and simplier way to save photos. Although I did gain some valuable insights, I also realized the questions I asked were too broad. I confirmed my theories about what people use cloud storage for and how they use it, but I could have asked deeper questions to uncover more specific pain points.</div>

          <div class="project-text">Next was understanding the competition. While Google Drive, Dropbox, and Pinterest are three very reputable companies, there is always room for improvement. I noticed that files could get quickly cluttered and disorganized. </div>

          <div class="project-text">
            For Notely to stand out against the competition, it would need these distinguishing features:
            <ul>
              <li>Multiple organization methods including folders, tagging, and searching</li>
              <li>Ability to save web links</li>

          <div class="project-title">Bringing the users to life</div>
          <div class="project-text">From the survey participants, I reached out to 3 individuals to interview. I found the main reasons why they used cloud storage and what they liked about it, but it was harder to discuss what problems they had with it because there was no major issues. From the surveys and interviews, two personas emerged. The common goals were efficiency and accessibility, meaning users want to quickly access their files on all devices. These are the main themes to keep in mind while designing and developing.</div>

          <div class="project-text">User stories help with simplifying the requirements of the project. It also helps prevent feature creep. This was important to establish in the beginning because clients may feel the need to add more features to stand out against competition. I brainstormed all the basic functionalities that Notely should have and then some more complex features. I prioritized the stories by which ones were absolutely needed for the MVP and which ones could come later. The user flows were a result of the top priority user stories: signing up for an account, creating a file, and sharing a file.</div>

          <div class="project-text">To have a better high level overview of the application, I created a sitemap. I needed to make sure the application’s layout was intuitive and straightforward before I began wireframing. I started off with very rough sketches of the landing page, main dashboard, and creating a new folder, and then I used Figma to create the low fidelity wireframes.</div>

          <div class="project-text">To begin testing, I created a prototype of the low-fi wireframes. I had participants test out three tasks: sign up for an account, create a folder, and share a file.
            <br><br>
            One of the key findings from the testing revealed that many users were confused by the concept of “Add Space”. I was trying to give users an easy way of categorizing their items by being able to create a “space” but it was essentially the same idea as folders. This was too repetitive and confusing so I decided to implement tags which gives users a simplier way to categorize their items.</div>

          <div class="project-text">Notely aims to be playful yet professional. It is the friendly application you can depend on when you need to find that document or save a photo. You can trustly Notely with your thoughts and ideas like a digital scrapbook. I wanted the playfulness, professionalism, and friendliness to be exemplified by the brand and logo.</div>

          <div class="project-text">Keeping the theme of playful and professional in mind, I started working on the logo. I knew I wanted to incorporate an element of note-taking. I originally envisioned the word NOTELY across a notepad but it seemed too simple. I decided to separate the notepad from the name and add a smile. People respond especially well to emotion and having a friendly logo may enhance the person’s experience.</div>

          <br><br>
          Lato was chosen as the primary typeface because it is simple, straightforward, and welcoming. Legibility and accessibilty were the driving forces in the font selection.

Instead of focusing on the current cloud storage applications that are out there, I needed to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Instead of asking how can I improve on the existing features, I needed to ask what about this product makes it user friendly.
          </div>
          <div class="project-title">If I had more time...</div>
          <div class="project-text">I realized that my target audience was too general. Most people who have used the reputable cloud storage applications have not faced many issues with it so it was harder to find their pain points. Instead, I should have interviewed people who don’t use cloud storage apps to uncover why they don’t and what would change their minds. I would do more market and user research.
